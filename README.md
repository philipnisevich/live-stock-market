# 📈 ESP32 Live Stock Tracker

**ESP32 Live Stock Tracker** – Solo-built device that fetches real-time stock prices over Wi-Fi, parses JSON, and displays tickers on an I2C OLED. Designed hardware, firmware, API handling, and UI. Learned microcontroller networking, JSON parsing, I2C displays, memory-efficient code, and building stable always-on embedded systems.
